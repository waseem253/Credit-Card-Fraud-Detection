# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
A simple Credit Card Fraud Detection Model for detecting the card whether it is valid or fraud. I used Jupyter Notebook.
I downloaded the dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/downloads/creditcardfraud.zip/3 
You can also download it from this link.
This is a unsupervised learning problem thats why i used two Unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
1-Local Outlier Factor (LOF).
2-Isolation Forest Algorithm.

I used all the data set but you can reduce it by using     "data = data.sample(frac=0.1, random_state = 1)" note : 
frac=0.1 means that i want to use 10% of data.
Good luck.
